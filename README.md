Sets headless screen resolution on Windows.  

It does this by:
 
- creating a new user called `rdp_local` 
- creating a startup script to RDP into the specified user account at specified resolution (default is 1920x1080) 
- adding a firewall rule to open RDP port 3389
- configuring auto-logon to login as `rdp_local` on reboot

Note that auto-logon requires a username and password and that the password is stored unencrypted under 
windows registry `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`.

Tested on Amazon Windows Server 2012 R2 AMI.

## Requirements

- Chef 11.6+ (registry_key resource)
- Windows Server 2008 R2+ (due to usage of [window_home](https://github.com/dhoer/chef-windows_home))

## Platforms

- Windows

## Dependencies
